## Lesson {{NUMBER}}: {{TITLE}}

A super important concept in any programming language are loops. For loops are kind of like if statements except they can repeat over and over again. Lets look at an example!

```py
x = 0

for x in range(5):
    print(x)
```

This loop will print the value of x until it reaches whatever is in the range. The int variable x starts at 0 and will keep increasing by 1 until it reaches the target in the range.

Note: Although the range is 5, it is not inclusive, meaning that the greatest value of x will be 4, not 5. Make sure you always go one number over the value you are expecting to reach in the range.

Take a shot at your own for loops! (You can even make an infinte loop that never ends!)
