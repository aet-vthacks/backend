## Lesson {{NUMBER}}: {{TITLE}}
It's time to create your first real python application!

In order to start developing applications where you can get inputs from the user, we must use the input() function. Let's look at an example below:

```py
num = input ("Enter number :")
print(num)
```

This will allow a user to enter whatever number they want and print out the stored value. The user must input this value into the console.

#### Objective: {{OBJECTIVE}}

An easy way to do this is to create three user input variables. Two can be used to store numerical values and one can be a string used to store operators like +, -, /, or *. Use an if statement to complete your calculations! **When Prining make sure you cast your variables as int**

```py
print(int(num)/int(num2))
```

---

Hint for one operator:

```py
num = input("first number: ")
num2 = input("second number: ")
op = input("operator: ")

if op == ("/"):
    print(int(num)/int(num2))
```
