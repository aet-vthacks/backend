## Lesson {{NUMBER}}: {{TITLE}}

Lists in python are mutable, meaning values can be added, removed, or changed. Let's take a look at how to do this:

```py
anime = ["Naruto", "Death Note", "Hunterxhunter"]

# to add to an array
anime.append("DragonBall")

# to delete from an array
anime.remove("Death Note")

# to modifiy a value
anime[2] = "Demon Slayer"
```

After these changes the array would look like this:

```py
anime = ["Naruto", "Hunterxhunter", "Demon Slayer"]
```
