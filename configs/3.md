## Lesson {{NUMBER}}: {{TITLE}}

Congrats! You have made it to the first logical part of programing in python!

If/else statements are used as conditionals. This means that if something is true, it will execute whatever is inside the if statement, if this is not true, it will either exit the statement OR go to the else portion of the statement.

Lets look at an example!

```py
test = 1

if test > 0:
    print("True!")

else:
    print("False")
```

The code above would never enter the *else* portion of the loop because the value of test is greater than 0.

Note: Make sure you indent your code inside the statements or it will not work! Indents are used so python knows when a line of code is inside a function.

Try your own if statement logic! Experiment with else functionality and see what you can create!
