## Lesson {{NUMBER}}: {{TITLE}}

For this lesson, we will be learning how to use variables. Variables in python work just like variables in math and are used to represent a number/value. When storing values in variables, make sure you pay attention to the type of what is in the variable.

| Type | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| int | whole numbers |
| float | longer numbers and numbers with decimals |
| boolean | True/False |
| String | words/characters, contained in “ “ |
Example of storing variables:

```py
number = 4 # int
word = "hello" # String
smallNumber = 0.4 # float
i = true # boolean
```

Try storing your own values in variables and experiment with naming! To see how you can use your variables, print them into the console like we did in the last lesson. <br>

Note: When printing a variable, you don't need to put " " around the variable or else it will print out the name of the variable rather than the contents stored inside.


```py
print(number)
```

## Lesson 2.5: Methods

An important concept in python are methods. Methods allow for whatever is written in them to be called upon at later points in the code if you want to reuse your previous code. Let's look at an example below!

```py
# method with no parameters
def exampleMethod():
    print("Hello World")

# method with parameter
def coolExampleMethod(x):
    print(x + 2)

# calling methods
exampleMethod()
# the above line will call the example method and print Hello World wherever the method is called.a

coolExampleMethod(9)
# the above line sets the variable x (a parameter) to the value of 9, when this method is called upon it will add two to whatever number is in the x parameter.

```

Parameters are variables for a method that are stated in the () at the begininning of a method. These variables can then be manipulated inside the method.

#### Objective: Put a parameter of type int into the method and print it out!

Experiment with different variables, types, and methods to see how they work!
