## Lesson {{NUMBER}}: {{TITLE}}

A good way to think of arrays or lists are that they are like a variable that stores multiple values of the same type. Lets look at some examples!

```py
# List of Strings
musicGenres = ["pop","hip-hop","rock"]

# List of ints
numbers = [365,432,234]

```

If you print a list like you would a variable, all the values stored in the list will print. To print one value at a time, you can use the syntax found below:

```py
# print the whole list
print(numbers)

# print a specific value
print(numbers[0])
```

This will only print the first value of the numbers list rather than the whole list.

Note: Lists start at 0 instead of 1, which is why the notation for the first value is [0] instead of [1], which is actually the second value. Make sure you are using the right number (called an index) when using specific values in an array.

#### Objective: {{OBJECTIVE}}

Have fun using arrays/lists to group together common types! Experiment with what you can store and how you can interate through an array to get your desiered value.
