## Lesson {{NUMBER}}: {{TITLE}}
A popular first program for programmers is the “Hello World” print statement.

To print something into the console, type:

```py
print("Hello World")
```

Note: Replace "Hello World" with whatever word/sentence you want to print in the console. Make sure you have “ ” around your word, this denotes the word as a String type, we will learn more about types later. Strings are used to store words/sentences and should always have “ “ around them.
